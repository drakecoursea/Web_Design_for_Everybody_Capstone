				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>The United Nations shares that "Climate Change is the defining issue of our time and we are at a defining moment". In the recent years, weather patterns have been changing, sea levels have been rising, resulting in impacts that hinders food production and cause flooding that render certain low-lying areas unhabitable. We therefore need to take action to save and protect our Earth, so that life can continue as we know it.</p>

				<h2>Waste Management</h2>
				<p>The National Environment Agency (NEA) is the government statutory board in charge of Singapore’s waste management systems and ensure that waste is properly collected, treated and disposed of.</p>

				<h2>Context of SG</h2>
				<p>Growth in Singapore’s population and economy have contributed to an increase in the amount of solid waste disposed of by about seven-fold since 1970. With waste quantities projected to continue increasing, Singapore's main challenge is the setting aside of land for waste disposal in view of limited land in Singapore.</p>
				<p>Singapore therefore adopts the following strategies in the diagram below for a more sustainable waste management system.</p>
